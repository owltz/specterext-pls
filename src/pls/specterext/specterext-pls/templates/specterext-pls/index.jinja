    <h1>Private Law Society (PLS)</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Simple and powerful private contracts built on Bitcoin and Nostr (optionaly).</p>
        <p>The biggest problem with private contracts until now was that they were still subject to State justice. Using PLS and creating your contract document following some good practices, the execution of the contract becomes governed exclusively by the parties involved and their arbitrators (freely chosen by mutual agreement).</p>
        <p>In short, collateral is deposited in a multisig wallet with the quorum desired by the parties. Any Bitcoin wallet with multisig support can be used to audit and validate the contracts created (requires good knowledge of multisig).</p>
        <p>Nostr is used (but not required) as a communication layer so that the entire signature flow is more user friendly. It is possible to have a completely offline client, where files (pdf, json, etc.) are exchanged externally (email, discord, etc.).</p>
